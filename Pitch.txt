**App Pitch: "TaskFlow - Collaborative Daily Productivity, Amplified"**  

**Tagline:**  
*"Sync Your Team’s Momentum. Conquer Tasks Together, Right When It Matters."*  

---

**Problem Statement:**  
In today’s fast-paced world, teams and individuals struggle with:  
- 📉 **Scattered to-do lists** across apps and sticky notes  
- 🤝 **Poor collaboration** on shared tasks  
- 🔔 **Ineffective reminders** that don’t align with peak productivity hours  
- 🗑️ **Lost context** when tasks disappear after completion  

**Solution:**  
**TaskFlow** reimagines team productivity as a **shared rhythm**, combining:  
- ✅ **Project-focused to-do lists** (persistent cards for ongoing goals)  
- 👥 **Seamless collaboration** (add members with one click)  
- 🚨 **Smart peak-hour nudges** (auto-reminders when your team is most active)  
- 💡 **Progress-focused design** (tasks stay visible until *you* decide they’re done)  

---

**Key Features:**  

1. **Team Pulse Dashboard**  
   - Visual project cards glow during your team’s peak hours (9 AM, 1 PM, 6 PM)  
   - See live updates as teammates check off tasks  
   - "Focus Mode" hides completed items without deleting history  

2. **Collaboration Made Frictionless**  
   - Invite members via email/link – no app install required for viewing  
   - Role-based permissions (owners/members)  
   - Comment threads on tasks (coming soon)  

3. **Intelligent Reminders**  
   - Customizable "peak hours" per project (e.g., "Code Sprint" alerts at 10 PM for dev teams)  
   - Gentle web notifications + optional SMS/email digests  
   - "Snooze" tasks to reappear in 1 hour/next day  

4. **Personalized & Persistent**  
   - Archive (don’t delete) completed projects for reference  
   - Private tasks visible only to you within shared projects  
   - Dark mode + customizable card colors

**Why TaskFlow Stands Out:**  

🔶 **For Individuals:**  
> *"Finally, a to-do app that adapts to MY rhythm – not the other way around. I keep freelance projects and personal goals in one place, and the 1 PM nudge is genius!"*  

🔶 **For Teams:**  
> *"Our remote design team lives in TaskFlow. The shared morning/afternoon reminder pulse keeps us aligned across time zones without endless Slack pings."*

**Technical Edge:**  
- 🔥 **Firebase-Powered**: Real-time sync, offline access, and military-grade security  
- 📱 **Progressive Web App**: Works instantly on any device, no app store required  
- 🤖 **AI Roadmap**: Smart task prioritization and automated standup summaries (Q4 2024)
